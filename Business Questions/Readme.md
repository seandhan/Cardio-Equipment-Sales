# Feature Engineering

The Age and Education variables can be categorized to improve data analysis

**Categorizing Age**


```python
# Define the age bins and labels
age_bins = [18, 24, 34, 44, 50]  # Define your age range boundaries
age_labels = ['YoungAdults', 'EarlyAdults', 'Adults', 'SeniorAdults']

# Create a new column with age categories
data['AgeGroup'] = pd.cut(
    data['Age'], bins=age_bins, labels=age_labels, include_lowest=True)
```

**Categorizing Education**


```python
# Define the Education bins and labels
education_bins = [12, 13, 15, 17, float("inf")]  # Define your education years range boundaries
education_labels = ['HighSchool', 'AssocDegree', 'Undergraduate', 'Graduate']

# Create a new column with Education categories
data['EducationLevel'] = pd.cut(
    data['Education'], bins=education_bins, labels=education_labels, include_lowest=True)
```

**Observations**
* The Age range distribution of all customers are heavily right skewed.
* The `TM195` Customers Age range was greater than both the `TM498` and `TM798`. This indicated the `TM195` is popular choice.
* The `TM798` customers had the smallest Age range with the most outliers. This indicates most of the customers are young adults.

**Product by Age with Gender split**


```python
sns.catplot(x="Age", y="Product", kind="box", data=data, showmeans=True, hue="Gender")
plt.show();
```

**Observations**
* The distribution of Female customers who purchased the `TM498` resembles a normal distribution
* Male customers who purchased `TM798` spanned a wider age range than the Female customers.
* The Age ranges of the Female customers across each model were less than the Males.

**Product by Age with Marital Status split**


```python
sns.catplot(x="Age", y="Product", kind="box", data=data, showmeans=True, hue="MaritalStatus")
plt.show();
```

**Observations:**

CardioGood should take an inclusive approach in marketing that avoids targeting narrow age ranges or lifestyles. Messaging and imagery for all models should appeal to a wide cross-section of adults across generations and relationship statuses. However, the data indicates opportunities to fine-tune brand positioning and partnerships by model based on core customer segments.

The TM195 treadmill should be promoted toward younger millennial fitness enthusiasts entering the category, highlighting introductory pricing and features. For the premium TM798 model, marketing should focus on performance-driven male runners based on their significant representation in this segment. Tactics like in-gym promotions and running event sponsorships can effectively reach this group. Additionally, TM798 messaging should highlight productivity features and advanced training data to align with educated professionals drawn to this top-tier model. In summary, while taking an inclusive approach, targeted outreach to align with the core demographics of each customer segment can help strengthen treadmill model positioning and marketing effectiveness.

## Is there a relationship between customer income level and the treadmill model purchased?

**Treadmill model vs Customer Income**


```python
# Plot of Treadmill model against customer income

sns.catplot(x='Income',
            y='Product',
            kind="box",
            data=data,
            showmeans=True,
            meanprops={"markerfacecolor": "red", "markeredgecolor": "red"},
            height=4,
            aspect=2,
            orient='h')
plt.title("Treadmill model across Income")
plt.show()
```


    
![png](output_76_0.png)
    


**Mean Income across Treadmill models**


```python
# Mean of Income across Treadmill models
data.groupby(by='Product').Income.mean()
```




    Product
    TM195    46418.025
    TM498    48973.650
    TM798    75441.575
    Name: Income, dtype: float64



**One way ANOVA for statistical significance of Customer Income across models**


```python
# Group your data by 'Product' and select the 'Usage' column
grouped_income_data = [group['Income']
                       for name, group in data.groupby('Product')]

# Perform ANOVA test
f_statistic, p_value = stats.f_oneway(*grouped_income_data)

# Display the results
print("F-statistic:", f_statistic)
print("P-value:", p_value)

# Interpret the results
alpha = 0.05  # Set your significance level
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference in mean customer income.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant difference in mean customer income.")
```

    F-statistic: 89.25903546601671
    P-value: 1.5644991316342494e-27
    Reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference in mean customer income.
    

**Observations:**

This analysis found income level strongly correlates with treadmill model selection. Specifically, the data showed customers with higher incomes overwhelmingly prefer the premium TM798 model.

To leverage this, CardioGood should make income a key factor in shaping TM798 marketing strategy and targeting. Messaging and partnerships should focus on highlighting the superior quality, performance, and prestige of the TM798. This positions it as an aspirational product for high-income earners. Tactics like digital ads geo-targeted by income levels can help reach affluent professionals identified as top prospects. Additionally, brand sponsorships of luxury events popular with wealthy consumers can further strengthen TM798's premium branding. In summary, showcasing the TM798 as a top-of-the-line model will resonate with high income customers and drive growth in this profitable segment.

**Observations:**

This analysis uncovered distinct usage profiles associated with each treadmill model. For the entry-level TM195, the majority of customers expected to use the treadmill sparingly, with average weekly usage of just 2-3 times. 25% of TM195 buyers plan to use the treadmill only once per week or less, indicating they purchased this model primarily for light or occasional cardio activity.

In contrast, customers of the mid-range TM498 model averaged 3-4 uses per week - a moderate increase versus TM195. For top-tier TM798, average weekly usage was highest at 3-5 times. The TM798 attracts committed runners looking to use their home treadmill consistently to train throughout the week.

Similar trends were seen for expected mileage. Average miles per week for TM195 customers peaked at 20-30. TM498 buyers saw a moderate uptick in planned mileage to 30-40 weekly miles. For TM798, average miles jumped substantially to 50+ miles per week, with some customers expecting to log over 100 miles.

These insights paint a picture of three distinct user profiles attached to each model. The TM195 appeals to casual walkers or light joggers. The TM498 suits users looking for consistency in moderate running. And the TM798 is optimized for enthusiasts training at high mileages.
